This website is in WIP! The aim of this project is to create an hypothetical professional website advertising Greek Underworld, I hope it will be a great experience and I can't wait for the final ressult! 
Lissen! I'm tired of bashing my head of my table because I can't understand coding. All my 1 year experience taught me the real opps are the professors! You are on your own bro! 
And the only chance to actually succeed in live is to create websites and learn JavaScript. Which is the sacrifice I'm willing to make!
